# AI Integration in America Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive dashboard analyzes and compares two distinct approaches to AI integration in America:
1. **AI Agents' Independent Analysis**: Expert AI agents provide domain-specific predictions and timelines
2. **OpenAI-US Government Blueprint**: Official partnership roadmap launched in January 2025

The development of this repository was inspired by OpenAI's blueprint on integrating AI in America's economy and society, to read the full blueprint, visit https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ai-in-america-oai-economic-blueprint-20250113.pdf

## Features

### AI Agents Timeline Tab
- **Main Timeline**: Visualizes complete integration timeline for each domain
- **Integration Progress Chart**: Shows projected S-curve adoption rates
- **Milestone Density Heatmap**: Displays concentration of key developments
- **Domain Relationships Network**: Illustrates interconnections between sectors
- **Detailed Agent Predictions**: In-depth analysis from each domain expert

### OpenAI-US Gov Blueprint Tab
- Timeline visualization of the official partnership roadmap
- Key milestones and policy initiatives
- Implementation strategies and frameworks

### Approach Comparison Tab
- Side-by-side analysis of both approaches
- Downloadable comparison report
- Key differences and similarities
- Areas of agreement and complementary strengths
